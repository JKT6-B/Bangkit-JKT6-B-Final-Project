# JKT6B Final Project for Bangkit Led By Google
# Dataset address is : https://github.com/agusekominarno/Batik
#
# We have no Batik name for each class, therefore we show similarity between images given and images from our database

 Batik-group is the folder that we created manually for training using inception_v3 and mobilenet_v2
 
 Batik-inception_v3.ipynb in folder program is implementing transfer learning using inception_v3
 
 Batik-mobilenet_v2.ipynb in folder program is implementing transfer learning using mobilenet_v2

 Batik300 is the folder dataset for Batik-Siamese-4_2.ipynb and Batik-Siamese-5_1.ipynb,
 
 Batik-Siamese-4_2.ipynb in folder program is recognizing batik with 4 images for train and 2 for test,
 
 Batik-Siamese-5_1.ipynb in folder program is recognizing batik with 5 images for train and 1 for test
 
 png file in the folder PNG is the screenshot of Result of ipynb's file

 you can implement or using this technique for small dataset that has a high similarity like images in the Batik300's folder
