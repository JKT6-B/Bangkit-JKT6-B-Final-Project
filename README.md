## Dataset 
 We make sure to thank you to Mr Agus that provide us with [Batik300 dataset](https://github.com/agusekominarno/Batik) for public consumption. Batik300 datasets really help us to explore batik much more and gave us knowledge about batik. 
 
## Problem
 We tried to make this project as optimal for the result as good as we can. For the time being we already tried every method and every algorithm, but for this case our problem is only small data for every class. We already tried to classify every images. the result still need more images for every 1 model batik image. We understand this problem may not sure to make our result better but we must try our best to finish this project as natural as possible.
 
## Documentation
For basic use Batik-group.rar to learn about the data partition before we start the project
### 1. Inception_v3 and mobile_v2
* You can try the code in this repo Batik-inception_v3.ipynb and Batik-mobilenet_v2.ipynb
* Get the dataset and import into notebook.
* This model using transfer learning to improve the optimization and getting the loss function.
* Try to configure the model from conv2D or using other optimization or loss to make the data more optimal
* You can use other sample image using this code and try it yourself.
### 2. Siamese Neural Network
* You can try the code in this repo, even though we have 2 files.
* Batik-Siamese-4_2.ipynb in folder program is recognizing batik with 4 images for train and 2 for test
* Batik-Siamese-5_1.ipynb in folder program is recognizing batik with 5 images for train and 1 for test
* This program surely call model Siamese Neural network and you can try using another
model image to implement using this algorithm
